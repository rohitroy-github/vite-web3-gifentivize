<h3>Project >>> <b>MordernCryptoTransact</b></h3>

This is a <b>Vite[React JS] + Web3.0</b> project where we can send <b>crypto currencies</b> to any specific address across the world with the help of <b>Blockchain</b>.
In addition to this a <b>GIF</b> will be added to every <b>transaction</b>, relevant to the <b>keyword</b> provided by the user<br />

Currently I'm testing the smart contracts over <a href="https://goerlifaucet.com/"><b>Goerli</a> Ethereum</b> test net integrated with <a href="https://hardhat.org/"><b>HardHat</b></a> Blockchain development environment ! <br />

This project is currently under development phase using Goerli test net. I'll be updating this live very soon, so feel free to add a star if you like the development !<br />
